# Client-Side-Form-Validation
A simple Pro Registration Form project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side validation, and Node.js with Express &amp; MongoDB for the backend. It allows users to register by filling out a form, validates the input on the client side, and stores the submitted data securely in a MongoDB database.
